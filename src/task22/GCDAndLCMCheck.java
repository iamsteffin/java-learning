// 6. Find GCD and LCM of Two Numbers
//Write two methods â€” one for GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and one for LCM (Least Common Multiple).
//For GCD: loop till min(a, b), find the largest divisor.
//For LCM: use formula LCM = (a*b)/GCD.

// we are defining gcd as 1 because every number is divisible by 1 and we try to find the smallest number because
// in gcd the divisor can be till the smallest number.
// we use the for loop with the condition where the loops end at smallest number
// then we use compare operator and if both a and b are completely divisible then that is gcd value and loop continues
// for lcm we use the formula lcm = (a*b)/gcd(a,b.
